TextToKeystrokes
================
TextToKeystrokes is a simple Windows app that will retype any text pasted into the window. The motivation was for
use on VMs connected through Guacamole that did not have any copy/paste functionality with the host/browser.

## Usage
 * Open TextToKeyStrokes.exe

You can click __Cancel__ to stop the keystrokes from starting, but once they're started, they won't stop until the text is complete. The best you can do is switch focus.
